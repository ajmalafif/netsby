<p class="mt0">One of my life goals is to create a fulfilling and balanced lifestyle, and extend it to people I love and care for the most.</p>

I went to Pennsylvania State University for college and have a degree in Actuarial Science.

I see myself as a journeyman that is always pursuing mastery by putting my knowledge into practice. I believe the best way to learn is by doing and also teaching.
